                    <p class="titre">My name is John and living the simple life saved my life</p>
                    <p class="contenu"> <span style="font-weight: bold;"> I used to be a pack rat
                        </span>I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even
                        appreciate any of it because there
                        was too much. <br><br> Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live
                        in, and I couldn't hold
                        a relationship <br> <br> <a href="">How I turned things around </a>  <br><br>
                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything   </span>. I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my
                        job <br> It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked 
                        <br> <br> <a href="">Now I live the simple life </a> <br> <br>
                        Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have
                        more free time to enjoy. <br> <br>
                        With how much it turned my life around,
                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it,
                        </span>
                        and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!
